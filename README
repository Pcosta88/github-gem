The GitHub Gem
=============

This gem'll work hand-in-hand with GitHub's API to help you out.

Some ideas:
  - Manage forks / remotes
  - Query the site (`svn info`)
  - git push + pull request

The project will have an open commit bit: send us a cool patch, get write access.  Let's do this.

I want to use this gem as a means of building out the GitHub API, as well.  read/write.

Catch me in the #github room on freenode if you want to get involved.  Or just fork and send a pull request.

Run it:
  $ ruby lib/github.rb <command> <args>

- defunkt @ github
